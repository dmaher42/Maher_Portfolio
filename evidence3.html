        <p><strong>Claim:</strong> I designed and implemented an 8-week invasion games unit built around the Aboriginal game <em>Parntu</em> (Team Parntu) to develop students’ movement skills, personal and social capabilities, and understanding of Aboriginal culture. The unit deliberately connected cultural learning with physical education and used a game-sense approach to scaffold tactics, technical skills and teamwork.</p>

        <p><strong>Evidence overview:</strong> This evidence set includes the full <em>Year 7 Invasion Games – Parntu Unit Weekly Planner</em>, the Parntu assessment portfolio template, and supporting resources embedded in the planner (e.g. teacher observation records, personal and social skills self-assessments, and GPAI tools). Together these show how learning intentions, activities and assessment were sequenced and aligned to movement and cultural outcomes.</p>

        <p><strong>Context:</strong> The unit was taught in Year 7 HPE and centred on the Kaurna game Parntu as an invasion game context. Students explored the cultural and historical significance of Parntu, connections to Country, and links to contemporary games such as Australian Rules football. Lessons used Yunkaporta’s 8 Ways of Aboriginal teaching (e.g. story sharing, learning maps, land and community links) alongside practical sessions where students played Parntu, modified games, developed tactics, and took on roles such as umpiring, coaching and setting up equipment.</p>

        <p><strong>Evaluate / Reflection:</strong> Students were highly engaged in both the cultural learning and the physical aspects of the unit. What began as warm-up activities often extended into full lessons because of the high level of interest and the rich opportunities to apply and refine movement strategies. Formative tools (teacher observation records, self-assessments, and GPAI data) provided ongoing evidence of growth in movement skills and personal/social capabilities. In future iterations, I plan to make the portfolio expectations more explicit earlier in the unit, build in more structured reflection points using the learning map, and strengthen the bridge into other invasion games (e.g. AFL) by making tactical links even more explicit for students.</p>

        <p><strong>How this meets the Standards:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Std 1.2 &amp; 1.3:</strong> Learning is structured around how students learn best (through physical activity, story, and collaboration) and is responsive to diverse cultural backgrounds through the use of an Aboriginal game and perspectives.</li>
          <li><strong>Std 2.1 &amp; 2.2:</strong> Content is carefully selected and sequenced from cultural understanding of Parntu to playing, analysing tactics, and applying movement concepts in invasion games.</li>
          <li><strong>Std 3.2 &amp; 3.3:</strong> The weekly planner shows a well-structured program that uses varied strategies (yarning circles, modified games, explicit skill practice, whole-part-whole) to promote deep learning.</li>
          <li><strong>Std 4.1 &amp; 4.2:</strong> Clear rules, non-contact expectations, and inclusive structures (e.g. yarning circles, shared roles, team culture) support participation and maintain a safe, orderly environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Std 5.1:</strong> Formative assessment (teacher observation records, self-assessments, GPAI) is built into lessons to monitor student progress and inform feedback.</li>
          <li><strong>Std 6.2:</strong> The use of Yunkaporta’s 8 Ways reflects engagement with professional learning about Aboriginal pedagogies and their application in HPE.</li>
          <li><strong>Std 7.1:</strong> Embedding Aboriginal histories and cultures into HPE aligns with ethical responsibilities to provide culturally inclusive and respectful education.</li>
        </ul>
