        <p><strong>Claim:</strong> I redesigned the original Year 10 Environmental Management Plan report task into a scaffolded Environmental Action Plan to better support students with diverse literacy needs, organisation, and task clarity, while maintaining the intended rigour of the Australian Curriculum: Geography.</p>

        <p><strong>Evidence Overview:</strong> The original BHS “Environmental Change and Management – Environmental Management Plan” task sheet (research plan + 800–1000 word report) and the modified Environmental Action Plan scaffold. The modified version breaks the assessment into smaller sections (Introduction, Regional Overview, Stakeholders, Environmental Issues, Environmental Management, Recommendations, Conclusion) and provides guided research questions, CRAAP-style source evaluation prompts, and sentence stems.</p>

        <p><strong>Context:</strong> Year 10 HASS class completing an Environmental Change and Management unit. The original task required students to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Complete a formal research plan and evaluate sources</li>
          <li>Interpret data from a range of digital technologies</li>
          <li>Write an 800–1000 word Environmental Management Plan report using specialist geographical terminology</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Several students struggled with the reading load, extended writing, and the open-ended nature of the report. Many found it difficult to know how to start, how to structure their ideas, and how to synthesise information into a coherent response.</p>

        <p><strong>Evaluate / Reflection:</strong> The modified Environmental Action Plan scaffold makes expectations visible and reduces cognitive load. Headings, prompts and simple language help students focus on one part of the task at a time (e.g. “Write a simple opening statement about the location you have chosen”, “List the people who care about this place and why”, “Choose one or two problems that affect the area and explain what they cause”). The built-in research plan and CRAAP prompts also support students’ source evaluation skills.</p>

        <p>Early use of the scaffold showed more students completing the full task and producing work that followed a clear structure, even when their writing level was lower. It allowed me to see quickly where students were getting stuck (for example “Environmental Issues” vs “Recommendations”) and respond with targeted teaching.</p>

        <p>In future iterations, I intend to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide two tiers of scaffold (high-support and medium-support versions) so that more confident writers can move towards greater independence.</li>
          <li>Co-construct an example Action Plan with the class to model quality responses and explicitly link back to the rubric language.</li>
          <li>Use the “Issues” and “Recommendations” sections as a formative checkpoint before the final submission, so I can adjust teaching and support students earlier.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>How this meets the Standards:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Std 1.5 / 1.6:</strong> The scaffold differentiates for a range of abilities by chunking the task, simplifying instructions, and adding guided prompts, supporting students who need more explicit structure (including those with additional learning needs).</li>
          <li><strong>Std 2.1:</strong> The task is firmly grounded in Year 10 Geography content on Environmental Change and Management, requiring students to use key terms (e.g. ecosystem services, degradation, sustainability) in an accessible format.</li>
          <li><strong>Std 2.3:</strong> The research plan and CRAAP-based source evaluation guide students to use geographical inquiry skills, interpret data, and make generalisations about environmental issues and management.</li>
          <li><strong>Std 3.2:</strong> The redesigned task shows careful sequencing of learning—from research planning, to data gathering, to structured written response—aligned with the unit’s inquiry questions.</li>
          <li><strong>Std 3.5:</strong> The scaffold functions as a classroom strategy that supports participation and keeps students engaged and on task, especially those who previously disengaged when faced with an 800–1000 word report.</li>
          <li><strong>Std 5.1 / 5.3:</strong> The modified assessment still allows valid judgement of the achievement standard, and the aligned rubric helps ensure consistency in assessing student understanding of environmental change and management.</li>
        </ul>
